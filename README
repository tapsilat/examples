# Tapsilat — Examples

Welcome to the Tapsilat examples repository — a collection of small, focused example projects and reference implementations demonstrating integrations, usage patterns, and starter code across multiple languages and platforms.

This repository is intended to help developers quickly find working examples in the language or framework they prefer and to serve as a reference when building on top of Tapsilat libraries and APIs.

## Contents

- go/          — Go examples
- java/        — Java examples (dashboard and others)
- php/         — PHP examples
- python/      — Python examples
- react/       — React examples
- ruby/        — Ruby examples
- rust/        — Rust examples
- typescript/  — TypeScript examples
- woocommerce/ — WooCommerce examples
- web/         — HTML/CSS/JS assets used by examples

(Each subdirectory contains one or more self-contained examples. Look for a README or instructions inside each folder for language-specific steps.)

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/tapsilat/examples.git
2. Change into the example you want to run:
   cd examples/<language>/<example-name>
3. Follow the language-specific instructions in that folder:
   - Java: check for Maven/Gradle or a README with run instructions
   - Go: run `go run` or `go build` after `go mod tidy`
   - Node/TypeScript/React: `npm install` or `yarn`, then `npm start` or `npm run build`
   - Python: create a virtualenv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the script
   - PHP: use Composer if present, or run with PHP built-in server
   - Ruby: run `bundle install` (if Gemfile present) then `ruby your_script.rb`
   - Rust: `cargo run`
   - WooCommerce: follow README in the woocommerce/ folder for plugin or integration steps

If an example folder does not include detailed instructions, open the source files and the repository-level documentation for guidance.

## How to use these examples

- Copy the example code you need into your project and adapt configuration (API keys, endpoints, credentials).
- Replace any placeholder values and secrets with your own environment variables or secrets store.
- Prefer running examples locally first before deploying to a staging or production environment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

- Open an issue for discussion if you want to add a new example or change an existing one.
- Fork the repository, add or update the example, include a short README in the example folder describing how to run it, and open a pull request.
- Keep examples small, self-contained, and documented (include commands to install dependencies and to run the example).

Guidelines:
- Use clear, minimal dependencies.
- Add tests where appropriate.
- Include license headers if adding third-party content.
